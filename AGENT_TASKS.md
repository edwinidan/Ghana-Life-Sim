# Ghana Life Sim — Agent Task Tracker

## How To Use This File

You are an AI agent working on **Ghana Life Sim**, a Flutter mobile life simulation game inspired by BitLife, built for a Ghanaian audience. Before doing anything, read this file top to bottom to understand where the project is and what to do next.

**Rules:**
- Tasks are ordered by build order — do not skip ahead. A task marked `TODO` may depend on all tasks above it being `DONE`.
- When you complete a task, change its status from `[ ] TODO` to `[x] DONE`.
- If a task is partially done or blocked, mark it `[~] IN PROGRESS` and leave a note underneath it explaining what was done and what is blocking it.
- For full project context, read `GHANA_LIFE_SIM_SCOPE.md` in the project root.
- All code lives in `lib/`. The main entry point is `lib/main.dart`.

**Status Key:**
- `[x] DONE` — complete and working
- `[ ] TODO` — not started
- `[~] IN PROGRESS` — started but not finished

- [x] DONE — "Live Again" button navigates back to CharacterCreationScreen

---

## Phase 2 — Save System

The save system must be built before any further systems are added. Without it, all progress is lost when the app closes, making testing painful and the game unshippable.

### 2.1 Add `shared_preferences` or `hive` Package
- [x] DONE — Add `hive` and `hive_flutter` to `pubspec.yaml` dependencies
- [x] DONE — Run `flutter pub get` to install
- [x] DONE — Verify package installs without conflict

> **Agent note:** Use `shared_preferences` for simplicity in v1. Hive can be adopted later if save complexity grows. Do not introduce both.

### 2.2 Create Save/Load Logic (`lib/services/save_service.dart`)
- [x] DONE — Create `lib/services/` folder
- [x] DONE — Create `SaveService` class with `saveGame(Character c)` method

- [x] DONE — Create `hasSavedGame()` method returning bool
- [x] DONE — Create `deleteSave()` method for when player dies and restarts

### 2.3 Wire Save Into Life Screen
- [x] DONE — Call `SaveService.saveGame()` after every age-up in `life_screen.dart`
- [x] DONE — Confirm save happens silently (no UI feedback needed in v1)

### 2.4 Wire Load Into App Entry
- [x] DONE — On app launch in `main.dart`, check `SaveService.hasSavedGame()`
- [x] DONE — If save exists, navigate directly to `LifeScreen` with loaded character
- [x] DONE — If no save exists, navigate to `CharacterCreationScreen` as normal

### 2.5 Wire Delete Into Death and Restart Flow
- [x] DONE — Call `SaveService.deleteSave()` when player presses "Live Again" on the death screen
- [x] DONE — Confirm new life starts fresh with no leftover data

---

## Phase 3 — Event Library Expansion

The event library must reach a minimum of 300 events before the game feels replayable. This phase expands the library systematically by category. Each sub-task is a writing and data task, not a code change — the event engine already handles any event added to `lib/data/events.dart`.

> **Agent note:** All events follow the exact same `LifeEvent` structure already established in `lib/data/events.dart`. Add new events to the `allEvents` list in that file. Keep the writing tone: funny, chaotic, culturally Ghanaian, with real consequences.

## What To Do Next

Phase 6 — Housing and Business Systems is complete, including the post-phase doing tab restructure (separate Housing and Business screens, scrollable main life screen).
The next incomplete task is Phase 7 — Health System Refinement.
Start there. Work downward through Phase 7 in order.
